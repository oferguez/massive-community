</div>

A simple Python CLI for natural language financial queries using the [Massive](https://massive.com/) [MCP server](https://github.com/massive-com/mcp_massive) and Anthropic [Claude 4](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4) via the [Pydantic AI Agent Framework](https://ai.pydantic.dev/agents/).

## Features

- **Ask questions like:**  
  `Tesla price now`  
  `AAPL volume last week`  
  `Show me the price of MSFT on 2023-01-01`

- **Rich CLI output:**  
  Answers are formatted for easy reading in your terminal.

## Quickstart (with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))

1. **Install uv:**
    ```sh
    curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

2. **Clone the repo & enter this example:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/massive-com/community.git
    cd community/examples/rest/market-parser-massive-mcp
    ```

3. **Create a `.env` beside `market_parser_demo.py`:**
    ```
    MASSIVE_API_KEY=your_massive_api_key_here
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
    ```
    Both keys are required for the CLI to work.

4. **Sync dependencies:**
    ```sh
    uv sync
    ```

5. **Run the CLI:**
    ```sh
    uv run market_parser_demo.py
    ```

6. **Type your question and press Enter!**  
   Type `exit` to quit.

## Example Usage

```
> Tesla price now
✔ Query processed successfully!
Agent Response:
$TSLA is currently trading at $XXX.XX (as of 2024-06-07 15:30:00 UTC).
---------------------

> exit
Goodbye!
```

For reference, this is the system prompt used with every query: 

```
system_prompt=(
    "You are an expert financial analyst. Note that when using Massive tools, prices are already stock split adjusted. "
    "Use the latest data available. Always double check your math. "
    "For any questions about the current date, use the 'get_today_date' tool. "
    "For long or complex queries, break the query into logical subtasks and process each subtask in order."
)
```

Be speficific in your prompt. The better the prompt - the better the response.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing API Key:**  
  If you see an error about `MASSIVE_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, make sure your `.env` file is in the same directory and contains both keys:
  ```
  MASSIVE_API_KEY=your_massive_api_key_here
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
  ```

- **Dependencies:**  
  If you get `ModuleNotFoundError`, rerun `uv sync` to rebuild the environment, then execute `uv run market_parser_demo.py` again.

- **Incorrect Responses**
AI Data can be incorrect. Like all LLM generated responses, please double check 

- **Other errors:**  
  All errors are printed in red in the terminal for easy debugging.
  If you get a 529, anthropic is rate limiting your requests.

## How it Works

- Loads your Massive and Anthropic API keys from `.env`
- Starts the Massive MCP server in the background
- Sends your natural language query to Anthropic Claude via PydanticAI
- Prints the answer in a readable format

## Enhancement Ideas

- Historical memory from previous chats
- Better error handling based on error codes
- Prompt chunking into individual tasks 
- Other tools or MCPs servers added to the agentic flow
